## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f3b5b17: fix: display variant-specific SKU, options, price and thumbnail for
  configurable requisition list items

  `ProductListTable` previously showed only the parent product's name/SKU and
  never rendered the selected configurable options (e.g. color, size), and the
  configured product's thumbnail was shown unconditionally, ignoring the
  storefront's "Configurable Product Image" setting used by the cart.

  - Renders the selected configurable options next to the SKU.
  - Adds a `useParentConfigurableThumbnail` prop to `ProductListTable`, driven
    by the new `configurable_thumbnail_source` store config field, so the
    thumbnail is consistent with the cart's admin-configured behavior.
  - Adds a built-in `enrichConfigurableProducts` default (exported from
    `@dropins/storefront-requisition-list`) that resolves the selected variant's
    SKU, price and thumbnail via Catalog Service's `refineProduct`, matching
    selected options by label, so integrators no longer need to implement this
    resolution themselves. Passing a custom `enrichConfigurableProducts` still
    overrides the default.

### Patch Changes

- 4a9f96b: Bump SDK stable versions
- 33ac652: fix: show original and final price in requisition list

  `ProductListTable` previously rendered only the final (discounted) price for
  an item's unit price and subtotal. It now also renders the original price with
  a strikethrough when a discount applies, for simple, configured, and bundle
  products, matching wishlist's price display.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- f047a2d: feat: add requisition list sharing feature (USF-3911)

  Introduces the ability for authenticated company users to share requisition
  lists with colleagues, either via a generated link or by email. Recipients can
  preview and import the shared list into their own account.

  - Add `shareRequisitionListByToken` and `shareRequisitionListByEmail` APIs to
    generate share links and notify colleagues
  - Add `getSharedRequisitionList` API to preview a shared list by token
    (read-only, sender info included)
  - Add `importSharedRequisitionList` API to copy a shared list into the current
    customer's account
  - Add `ShareRequisitionListContent` component and container with copy-link and
    email recipient selection UI
  - Add `SharedRequisitionList` component and container to preview and import a
    shared requisition list by token and redirect to the list detail page on
    success
  - Extend `useRequisitionListAlert` with `import` action for success/error
    feedback after import
  - Extend `getStoreConfig` with sharing-related store config fields
  - Emit `auth/permissions` in sandbox on login/logout to correctly enable the
    share button for company users
  - Added `SharedRequisitionList` button in sandbox

- 66b8852: Removed the `engines.node` constraint from `package.json`. This
  package targets browser environments exclusively and does not depend on a
  specific Node.js runtime version. The package is now built and distributed
  using Node.js 22 LTS.

### Patch Changes

- c809d65: fix: correct isCompanyUser detection for B2C customers (USF-3911)

  The `auth/permissions` listener now checks specifically for `admin: true` or a
  `Magento_Company::*` key to identify company membership, instead of treating
  any truthy key beyond `all` as proof. This prevents non-company permissions
  from being mistaken for company membership.

  Also aligns the `routeSharedRequisitionList` prop parameter name to
  `relativeUrl` across `RequisitionListHeader` and `RequisitionListView` to
  match `ShareRequisitionListContent`.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4205285: feat: add Move to List and Copy to List features for requisition list
  items

  - Add `moveItemsBetweenRequisitionLists` API to move items from one
    requisition list to another, removing them from the source and adding to the
    destination
  - Add `copyItemsBetweenRequisitionLists` API to copy items between requisition
    lists, keeping items in the source list
  - Add `RequisitionListPicker` reusable component for selecting a requisition
    list from a scrollable list of cards
  - Add "Move to List" and "Copy to List" bulk action buttons in the requisition
    list view, with modal-based list selection
  - Refactor `RequisitionListSelector` to use `RequisitionListPicker` for
    consistent list selection UX
  - Include destination list name in success alert messages for both move and
    copy operations

- 9fdf4f4: Add an an active class and prop to the **RequisitionListSelector** so
  the button on the PDP page can reflect when the current product is already in
  the requisition list. Both an `active` prop as well as
  `requisition-list-selector--active` class was added. In addition, the
  `activeIcon` was also included should that the developer would like to change
  the button icon once an active state is truthy.
- 98cd3b9: fix: merge user-provided langDefinitions in Provider

  The Provider now imports `config` and uses `deepmerge` to merge user-provided
  `langDefinitions` with the drop-in's bundled defaults before passing them to
  `UIProvider`. This enables label/placeholder overrides via the initializer
  API.
